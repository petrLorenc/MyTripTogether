  * 40 billion US dollars market in Europe
  * More on sightseeing than shopping
  * Booking online is getting more important
  * Travelers want to visualize potential new experiences. How will it make them feel? What photos will they have to share with friends and family afterwards?

  * During 2015, EU residents made 1 172 million trips with overnight stays - regardless of destination and duration. Of these, 10.6 % were trips for professional purposes, while the remaining 89.4 % were trips made for personal purposes
  * In 2015, 58.2 % of the tourism trips that EU residents made were short, a maximum of three overnight stays
  * On average for the EU, three out of four trips were domestic trips.
  * Trips of four nights or more accounted for 41.8 % of all tourism trips (23.8 % with a domestic destination and 17.9 % with a destination outside the country of residence).
    * Source: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Tourism_statistics_-_characteristics_of_tourism_trips

  * U.S. domestic travel increased 1.9 percent in 2017 to a total of more than 2.25 billion person-trips.1 Domestic leisure travel increased 2.0 percent in 2017 to nearly 1.8 billion person-trips.2 Leisure travel accounted for 79.4 percent of all U.S. domestic travel in 2017. Domestic business travel increased 1.7 percent from 2016 to 464 million person-trips.

1 172 000 000 * 0.9 (personal) * 0.7 (not-solo) * 0.17 (more than 4 days and outside country) = possible trips with using our app = 125 521 200 (approximation, because of combination of numbers from US and Europe). So, without further research the real number of trips is more than 100 000 000. We don't need to exclude families, because they are also valid target audience, but we won't aim on them with new features at the beginning, so the real number would be in order of milions (for Europe).

**Revenue possibilities**

  * Providing premium service with also booking accommodation, reserve ticket for attraction
  * Based mainly on advertisement
  * Special fee for groups with more than 5 people
  * Special fee for schools and universities
  * **Alternative**
    * Be free with aiming to getting as many users as possible 
    * Exit with selling user base to big travel company
