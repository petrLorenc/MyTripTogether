You are fan of travalling, right? Who isn't but imagine that you want to go for a trip with your peers and you just decided that some country is best, because the flight tickets to go there are so cheap. Then, there are usually two ways. One group do planning in advance and see as much as possible, the other group doesn't plan much and get suprised after arriving. Both approaches have some plus and minus but we can generally say that the first group will see usually more interesting places and will be more satisfied with a trip. Now is the time for our tool which want to provide even more easily way how to plan a trip. We does not focus on the whole process of planning (YET), but this tool make the whole process of decising very easy for you and then also suggest you the best possible route between them (with car/scooter/bus/horse ...). And if something help me with decising then I will use it.
