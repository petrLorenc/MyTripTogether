# MyTripTogether

## Why?

As a developer, I would like to explore the area behind the Project Management. This project should provide testbed for me to explore this area deeper. I will be following publicly available sources and also the books. I will try to take a look at each part of development process from talking with stakeholder to delegating a work to programmers (I will represent that position mostly by myself).

## How?

Each "meeting" will be represented as a standalone document in folder "meetings". The format will be following "DD-MM-YY-Topic"

Example Header of the document:

//DD-MM-YY-Topic
//Parties included
//Input: XX
//Expected output: YY

I will also create a folder for each tool, where I put some additional and useful information about that tool (tutorial, cheatsheets ...)

Example Header:

//Name:
//Where and when to use
